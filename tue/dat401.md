## DAT401 - Amazon DynamoDB Deep Dive: Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB

#### Rick Houlihan - Principal Technologist, NoSQL
Stream : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k

#### Agenda
- Brief history of data processing
- overview of DynamoDB
- NoSQL data modling
	- normalized vs de-normalized schema
- common nosql design patterns
	- composite keys, etc
- model real applications

#### History
- data normalization/RDS came about because storage was expensive
- now that storage is cheap and CPU is expensive it makes less sense

#### DynamoDB
- three way replication on write (get confirmation after 2 are done)

- LSI (local secondary index) gives alternate sort key
	- index is local to a partition key
	- ![  ](../images/20181127_174512.jpg)

- GSI (global secondary index)
	- index is across all partition keys
	- use composite sort keys for compound indexes
	-  if GSI doesn't have enough write capacity then table writes can be throttled on updates
-  Scaling noSQL

	-  create tables where partition key element has a large number of distinct values and values are requested fairly uniformly as randomly as possible

- tenants of nosql data modeling
	- understand the use case
	- identify the access patterns
		- read/write workloads
	- data-modeling
		- avoid relational design patterns

	- review -> repeat -> review

#### Complex Queries
- Dynamo streams and lambda
- precompute things that you may have used SQL for previously
