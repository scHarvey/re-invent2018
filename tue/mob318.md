##### REST
- everything is a resource
- server driven selection
- multiple round trips to fetch related resources
- over fetching/under fetching ^
- Hypermedia <-- ***enhanced REST***
- overfetching costs both bandwidth and compute cycles in gathering the data
- underfetching causes extra HTTP requests because you need to go back to get more data from another service

##### GraphQL
- application query language
- single http call
- fetch exactly what you need
- co-locate resources
- central "API" allows you to have single authentication/entitlement point of interface
- Schema Definition Language
	- GraphQL Type System
- strong typing helps keep back end verification/validation on the server

##### Migration Patterns
- Client Side Migration
	- Pros
		- easy to maintain backwards compatibility
- Wrap a REST API with GraphQL
	- Pros
		- easy to maintain backwards compatibility
		- more sconsistent model across clients
	- Cons
		- does not utilize all the benefits of graphql
		- be aware of the limitations on the backend (throttling, etc)
- Brand new endpoint using GraphQL
	- Pros
		- fully utilizes GraphQL benefits
		- consistent domain model
		- better handling of partial results
	- Cons
		- more effort
		- lack of backward compatibility

#### Tidbits
- GraphQL - elements at the same level are resolved in parallel
- three action types
	- queries - get
	- mutation - updates/inserts/deletes
	- subscription
- field level entitlements to control what people can select in a query
- appsync has 1mb resolver hard limit
	- page calls
- graphql can sit behind api gw
- is possible to also wrap graphql with a REST api
- Richardson maturity model **<-- look in to**
