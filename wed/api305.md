###### SQS
- if producer has issues sending message, but queue recieved it, and then producer retries, queue doesn't know it's a duplicate
- invisibility timeout
	- if a consumer can't process a message just forget about it and the invisibilty timeout will expire and someone else will retry.
	- if you processed the message then tell the queue to delete the message

```flow
p1=>producer1: Producer
p2=>producer2: Producer
q=>queue: SQS
c1=>consumer1: Consumer
c2=>consumer2: Consumer
c3=>consumer3: Consumer

p1->q->c1
```
