###### SQS
- if producer has issues sending message, but queue recieved it, and then producer retries, queue doesn't know it's a duplicate
- invisibility timeout
	- if a consumer can't process a message just forget about it and the invisibilty timeout will expire and someone else will retry.
	- if you processed the message then tell the queue to delete the message
