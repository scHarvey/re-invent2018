- 90% of CEOs believe their industry will be digitally disrupted
- Less than 15% are well positioned to execute on a digital strategy

#### Notes
- dev/sec ops "blessed patterns" to speed up infrastructure deployment
	- though this means that dev/sec ops and architecture need to be ahead of the curve with developing accepted patterns
- business is in trouble if pace of innovation outside is quicker than the pace of innovation inside

#### Best and Worst Practices
- anti-patterns
	- unrealistic climb
		- 5 year plan without plans for course correction is bad
		- ambitious goals are good, but if you don't have the means (knowledge, money, buy-in) then it becomes unrealistic
	- guarding the status-quo
	- take a bow, HIPPO
	- fit into shirt
	- scope creep battle
- patterns
	- frequent wins
	- continuous refactor
	- continuous validation of hypothesis
		- keep trying to prove hypothesis wrong
		- if you can't prove it wrong, it MIGHT be right
	- inclusiveness
		- share wins, and loses (with lessons learned) with the wider organization
	- built-in (vs bolt-on)
